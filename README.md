# DSA Learning Universe - Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

Welcome to the DSA Learning Universe! This interactive web application helps students and enthusiasts visualize and understand various sorting algorithms step-by-step.

## Features

* **Multiple Algorithms:** Visualize Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort (with first element pivot), and Merge Sort.
* **Interactive Visualization:** Watch algorithms work in real-time with clear visual cues for comparisons, swaps, pivots, minimums, and sorted elements.
* **Playback Controls:** Play, pause, and step through the algorithm's execution at your own pace.
* **Adjustable Speed:** Control the animation speed for better understanding.
* **Custom Input:** Enter your own array of numbers or letters (comma-separated).
* **Array Generation:** Quickly generate different types of test arrays:
    * Random
    * Nearly Sorted
    * Reversed
    * Few Unique Values
* **User-Defined Size:** Specify the size for generated arrays (within limits).
* **Detailed Explanations:** Kid-friendly, step-by-step explanations describe what the algorithm is doing at each stage.
* **Algorithm Information Panel:** Learn more about each algorithm, including:
    * Simple description
    * Time and Space Complexity (Best, Average, Worst)
    * Stability and In-Place characteristics
    * Simplified pseudo-code view.
* **Dynamic Code Highlighting:** See the corresponding pseudo-code lines highlight as the algorithm executes.
* **Responsive Design:** Works on various screen sizes (desktop recommended for best experience).
